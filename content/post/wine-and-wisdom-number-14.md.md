Once again the  annual  quiz, held in March in Bratton Clovelly Parish Hall with it's new Green Energy Heating and Lighting, proved very popular with the many attendees who have been supporting for several years as well as  most welcome new competitors. An enjoyable evening resulted in a team, made up on the evening,  of regular competitors, the Isaacs family from Launceston and the Goodwins from Sticklepath, earning a well deserved win.  Thanks went to the Question Master, David Arney, all who had helped with the preparations and throughout the evening, and to all who had attended, making it a very successful event.
