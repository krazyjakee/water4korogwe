Once again we send our thanks to Richard Taylor for compiling a very interesting quiz for DAK funds, this time regarding Dartmoor Tors which was much enjoyed.   There seem to be many more named tors than a lot of people knew about!  The winners were neighbours, Mrs Pratt and Mrs Purves  from Cullompton who each had 23 correct answers to the 25 questions and decided they would like to share the small prize.   Thank you to all who took part.
