On Sunday 14th June three local ladies entered the annual thirteen and a half miles Ruby Run between the market towns of Hatherleigh and Holsworthy in West Devon. In sunny conditions with a gentle breeze they joined those who chose to walk rather than run, getting to the finishing line in three and a half hours. DAK says a big thank you to Helen, Mo and Pam for raising funds.
