Marilyn Cooper has been running seriously and riding horses  for some time. This year she has qualified in the Welsh Marathon to participate in the London Marathon on April 22nd 2012. She also made a visit to Africa this year and has decided she would like to run for DAK. We are most grateful to her for her kind thinking and if anyone would like to sponsor Marilyn, forms can be obtained by emailing our address.

Huge congratulations and sincere thanks go to Marilyn for her very successful run on Sunday. She ended in the excellent position of 85th out of 388 runners in her age group with the  time of 4 hours and 14 minutes - brilliant!  Sponsorship money is still being collected and we thank all those who have supported her to help DAK.
