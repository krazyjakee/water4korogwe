We have attended some of the local summer shows and have been delighted - and most surprised - to win a First Prize rosette for the Charity Trade Stand at Chagford Agricultural Show, and then the Citizens of the Year Award for the work towards Â DAK at the Hatherleigh Rotary's Fun Day!

None of DAK's projects can happen without the wonderful support we receive from so many generous people. Big Thank You's to all!
