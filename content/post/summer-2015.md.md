We were pleased to have sold 207 quiz sheets to work out the clues to find Devon Place Names.  Throughout the large area covered by the sales many spent hours pondering and enjoying, many found it ‘drove them mad’ but were determined to complete, saying it provided  good entertainment for families and friends spending time together. Only fourteen were brave enough to return their completed sheets – and the winner with forty correct answers to the forty two questions was Valerie Martin from Bratton Clovelly and she won the shopping voucher.

Our thanks go to all those who took part and especially to Richard Taylor who came up with the idea and compiled the questions.
