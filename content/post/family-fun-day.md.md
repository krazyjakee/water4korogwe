As part of her Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme a young local schoolgirl, with the help and support of her family and friends, arranged a great day at the Parish Hall to raise funds. There were a number of local stallholders with a wide variety of goods for sale, many side activities - including an opportunity to guess where, in a marked area, the pony would dung. A rounders match between the local Young Farmers' Club and Hunt supporters resulted in the cup, and trophies, being won by the Hunt. The usual raffle,treasure hunt, tombola, roll the coin, a stall filled with delicious cakes, and some excellent home made refreshments all contributed to a most entertaining and successful afternoon.

We thank Kirsty for all her worthwhile efforts resulting in the generous funds towards half the cost of a well with a pump. Brilliant!
