Parents and friends were invited  to join the forty three pupils from the village Primary School to celebrate the annual harvest at the Methodist Church. The choice of music,  song and drama was wonderfully suited to DAK's purpose and to the children's admirable performances which they were obviously enjoying.

" I think you should know that it matters to me what happens to people far over the sea."

Such awareness of less fortunate children's lifestyles and problems is much to be encouraged. It was an altogether praiseworthy celebration. Thank you to both the children and staff!
