Following many months of hard work by contractors and villagers working in  difficult rocky surroundings  we were met by women singing and dancing. It was a great delight to find the completed pipeline working efficiently to supply seven taps with a good strong pressure of clean water.  The villagers were very happy. The training for maintenance and hygiene given to a cross section of the community included men, women and school children.This was all made possible by an incredibly generous donor to whom sincere thanks are given.

Due to the dry season the water table was fairly low in some villages but the pumps were in use at rationed times and a number of requests were made for further wells to be installed. The communities are collecting their contributions in readiness for that to happen. In addition, villages where spring boxes and pipelines will be more appropriate were visited and surveys will be carried out.
