Saturday September 17th 2011 is a night to look forward to.

Home Brew Country Dance Band is coming to Bratton Clovelly Parish Hall to help us raise funds and have a good time. There will be a bar and refreshments - and lots of good music.  Further details later.

Put the date in your diary now.

 

Saturday's event was much enjoyed by all the dancers. The music was great and fun was had by all.
