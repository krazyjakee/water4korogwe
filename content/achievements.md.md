[[**Achievements So Far**]

[In the villages that DAK has already helped, the women don't have such long distances to walk to fetch clean water for their families. School teachers tell how more children are attending school regularly because they are no longer drinking the contaminated water that so frequently made them ill.]

[Fetching the water can also be dangerous.]

[Many rivers are dangerous places to obtain drinking water, often polluted and crocodile infested. In many instances the water has to be shared by livestock adding further health risks. DAK has installed shallow wells in situations like these, but there are still many more villages waiting for help.]

[Sometimes there is water in the river - sometimes it has dried out.]

[Other communities have a good clean spring up in the mountains - although this means a long and tiring trek. DAK installs gravity piped schemes to help these villages.]

[[DAK insists on a 'partnership' with the villagers so that they are made to feel responsibility and ownership towards their new water supplies. If contributing their labour is not an option, because of the topography of the area, then a financial contribution is agreed upon. They are made aware of the importance of good hygiene practices and encouraged to look after the pumps with regular maintenance.]

[Women have more time and energy for other occupations like tending their crops or generating some form of income activities.]

[Trustees frequently visit the area to check that all is being done as it should be and to hold village meetings to keep up to date. ]
