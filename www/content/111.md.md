As part of his Duke of Edinburgh Award this year, Silas will be biking the 100-mile route from Ilfracombe to Plymouth, to raise money for Devon Aid Korogwe. This is a small charity which concentrates on bringing clean water to villages in Korogwe District in Tanzania – exactly the area where his mother was based when she was a VSO – and he's keen to support the work they do. Clean, accessible water has been brought to thirty-seven villages since 2000, using locally sourced and repairable equipment and working through proper grassroots partnerships.
If you would like to sponsor Silas, you can either send him a cheque made out to ‘Devon Aid Korogwe’ or donate online, which can be done on the form to the right.

Silas, accompanied by his friend, Ken, completed the Coast to Coast cycle ride, passing through Okehampton. The first day they experienced heavy rain, the second was sunny and the amazing total raised so far is almost reaching £1,000. Brilliant Silas!! Thank you very much!! Thanks go also of course to all sponsors, without whom it wouldn't be as much!
