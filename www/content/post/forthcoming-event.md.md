A young people's choir  from London is coming to Okehampton, Devon to give a concert especially for DAK in the Fairplace Church.   Their ages range from eleven years to about twenty two years with the majority in their mid teens. It would be lovely to have a full attendance to welcome them.

The **Dunamis Gospel Choir** will be at the **Methodist Fairplace Church** in **Okehampton  7 pm Saturday August 31st.**

Entry £5, children under eleven years £2.50, to include tea/coffee/juice and biscuits.

After a day on the moor, enjoying plenty of fresh air and amazing views from the top of Haytor, the Dunamis Youth Gospel Choir from London gave a great concert at the Fairplace Church to  help raise funds.  There was a good attendance to hear their singing, instrument playing and to learn about some of their life changing stories.
