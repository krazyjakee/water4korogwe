As ever, the weather played an important role at the local agricultural shows.  It was a first time visit for DAK to attend at Launceston in July when we made several new contacts - and were even lucky enough to win third prize for a Non Agricultural Trade Stand.

It was a good dry day at Okehampton, a good site and plenty of regulars coming along to learn of projects' progress. A week later we were at Chagford where, once again, we were met by many supporters as well as people wanting to learn about what the charity does. We almost lost the gazebo in a sudden gust of wind, but fortunately the parked landrover made an excellent trap to stop it from disappearing over the field. It was going home time anyway!

Holsworthy was a different kettle of fish all together. Sadly, there had been alot of rain and several vehicles were having to be towed devonaidkorogwe.wordpress.2019-01-05.xml to the show field.  By the end of the day it was certainly a task not to be taking home too much mud! We had met up with many old friends and  thoroughly enjoyed the day.

After a couple of years without its popular annual Balloon Festival, Tavistock was back once  again offering some wonderful entertainment to a vast number of people. Despite somewhat breezy conditions there was plenty to be seen; the evening Balloon Glow attracted a most appreciative crowd and DAK made several new contacts.

Many thanks go to granddaughter and all the supporters  we had to help DAK throughout the summer months to promote the hard lifestyle of those less fortunate Tanzanian villagers, and to help find  more local followers.
