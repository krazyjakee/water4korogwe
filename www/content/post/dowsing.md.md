The irony of having rain falling as the class was learning how to search for water didn’t deter those who attended a most interesting and informative day presented by Aaron Bray from the British Society of Dowsers.  Several arrived with a very cynical approach to the concept, but left feeling that even they might find the  practical knowledge gained would be useful. It was great fun to discover we could find not only water but also electric cables and plastic pipes!

Thanks go to Aaron for his great presentation to support Devon Aid Korogwe, and to all those who attended such an enjoyable event.
