Our fundraisng evening in the historic Buckland House was a very  enjoyable time. Roger and Christine Cleverdon once again entertained us to some of the music and songs of Flanders and Swann and the audience joined in with choruses from songs by Jan Stewer. Tony Cox amused us all with his great jokes and tales and a great time was had by all - many travelling lengthy distances to be present. The very tasty supper was prepared and served by Rachel Bewes and her helpers.

A different venue was Cookbury Parish Church where Ann and Stan Bird invited DAK to give a power point presentation and when attendees were given an excellent snack lunch. There was also a gathering in the Village Hall at Germansweek when  Sylvia Kaye offered a wonderful afternoon tea for those who came to see another powerpoint presentation.

Last Friday 29 teams came together at Bratton Clovelly Parish Hall for another successful annual Wine and Wisdom quiz with Question Master David Arney. Once again the winners, Richard Verschoyle and Friends squeezed into the winning position ahead of The Isaacs Family who were present with only an incomplete team.

Some great and successful fundraisers and, as with all our events, we are very grateful for all the help and support given by local friends with the preparations and manning the various chores throughout.
